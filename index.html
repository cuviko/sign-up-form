            <p>There is no end though there is a start in space. — Infinite.
                It has (its) own power, it ruins, and it goes though there is a start also in the star. — Finite.</p>
            <p>Only the person who (has) wisdom can read the most foolish one from the history.</p>
            <p>The fish that lives in the sea doesn't know the world in the land. It also ruins and goes if they have
                wisdom.</p>
            <p>It is funnier that man exceeds the speed of light than fish start living in the land.</p>
            <p>It can be said that this is (a) final ultimatum from the god to the people who can fight.</p>
